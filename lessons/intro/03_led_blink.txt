Requirement:
Arduino uno board
Arduino IDE 
USB cable

Lesson:
Connect arduino board to PC usb port
  make sure led light is on next to "on"
  this shows arduino board is working

Open arduino IDE
  click arduino IDE icon and open integrated development environment
  you will see a window, click Help, About Arduino to see version

Create new file
File, New, or Control + N
  type the following 

// code start
int led = 13;

void setup(){
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}

void loop(){
  Serial.println("Led blnik start");
  digitalWrite(led, HIGHT);
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(led, LOW);
  delay(1000);
  Serial.println("Led blnik start");
}

// code end

Check output
  you can see arduino board digital pin 13 led blinking every one second
  

Extra step
  change delay(1000) to
  delay(5000)

  this changes led blink time interval to 5 seconds
  led light stay 5 seconds
  led shut off 5 seconds
